ShellSQL - Commands
</font>
<p>

<b>1 - Connection Commands.</b>
</p><p>

<b>1.1 - Introduction</b>
</p><p>

These sets of commands establish a connection to the database.  They all
operate in a similar way in so far as much they initiate a background
SQL client and output a handle that is used in subsequent ShellSQL commands
to use it. For example....
</p><p>
</p><pre>        HANDLE=`shpostgres dbname=test`
</pre>
<p>
Note the backquotes there. 
</p><p>

On success it returns 0.
On an error they output nothing and effect a return code
of 1.   An error message may appear on the standard error output.
</p><p>


<b>1.2 - shpostgres</b>
</p><p>

This initiates a PostgreSQL connection.  The syntax is....
</p><p>
</p><pre>        shpostgres connectarg [connectarg] ...
</pre>
<p>

The connectarg(s) are concatonated together separated by spaces.  So for
example, the following is perfectlly legal....

</p><p>
</p><pre>        shpostgres dbname=test user=myuser
</pre>
<p>

which does the same thing as

</p><p>

</p><pre>        shpostgres "dbname=test user=myuser"
</pre>
<p>
Either way, the arguments of the engne take the form of <code>name=value</code>
where <code>name</code> is one of the following.  The are the same as the ones used
in <code>PQconnectdb()</code> in PostgreSQL's libpq library.  Most have sensible defaults.
</p><p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="5">
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left"><code>host</code></td>
<td align="left">The host name of the server</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>hostaddr</code></td>
<td align="left">The host IP address of the server</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>port</code></td>
<td align="left">The TCP port number to connect to on the server</td>

<td align="left"><code>dbname</code></td>
<td align="left">The database name</td>

<td align="left"><code>password</code></td>
<td align="left">The password for the user</td>

<td align="left"><code>connect_tomeout</code></td>
<td align="left">The connection timeout in seconds, 0 is indefinate</td>

<td align="left"><code>options</code></td>
<td align="left">Command line options to be sent to the server.  See Postgres documentation for more details.</td>

<td align="left"><code>sslmode</code></td>
<td align="left">the SSL mode for the connection, This is either <code>disable</code>, <code>allow</code>, <code>prefer</code> or <code>require</code>.</td>

<tr>
<td align="left"><code>service</code></td>
<td align="left">Name of service that holds extra parameters.  See Postgres documentation for more details.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p>


If you are using the password assignment in the connection then you should
use the "password=mysecret" string as a separate parameter.  The reason for
this is that "shpostgres" will detect it and blank it out in the process
table so someone else doing a "ps" cannot see it.
</p><p>


<b>1.3 - shmysql</b>
</p><p>

This initiates a MySQL connection.  The syntax is....
</p><p>
</p><pre>        shmysql connectarg [connectarg] ...
</pre>
<p>

The connectarg(s) are concatonated together separated by spaces.  So for
example, the following is perfectlly legal....

</p><p>
</p><pre>        shmysql dbname=test user=myuser
</pre>
<p>

which does the same thing as

</p><p>

</p><pre>        shmysql "dbname=test user=myuser"
</pre>
<p>
Either way, the arguments of the engne take the form of <code>name=value</code>
where <code>name</code> is one of the following.  Most have sensible defaults.
</p><p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="5">
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left"><code>host</code></td>
<td align="left">The host name or IP address of the server</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>port</code></td>
<td align="left">The TCP port number to connect to on the server</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>dbname</code></td>
<td align="left">The database name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>user</code></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>socket</code></td>
<td align="left">The name of the UNIX socket if applicable</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>flag</code></td>
<td align="left">Usually not defined or zero, but can be used in special circumstances, see the documentation in MySQL for further information.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

table so someone else doing a "ps" cannot see it.
</p><p>



<b>1.4 - shsqlite3</b>
</p><p>

This initiates a SQLITE3 connection.  The syntax is

</p><p>
</p><pre>        shsqlite3 databasefilename
</pre>
<p>

Where databasefilename is the name of the SQLITE3 database to open.
</p><p>

<b>1.5 - shsqlite</b>
</p><p>

This initiates a SQLITE version 2 connection.  The syntax is

</p><p>
</p><pre>        shsqlite databasefilename
</pre>
<p>

Where databasefilename is the name of the SQLITE version 2 database to open.  
</p><p>


<b>1.6 - shodbc</b>
</p><p>

This initiates an ODBC connection.  The syntax is

</p><p>
</p><pre>        shodbc user password connectionstriing
</pre>
<p>

where the user and password (which need to be there own parameters, NOT
incorporated in the connection string) are just that, and the connection
string is a (number of) parameters that constitute the connection string.
</p><p>

There is another parameter that can be passed using the environment
variable ODBC_TIMEOUT, which contains the login timeout in seconds.
This defaults to 20 if not defined.
</p><p>

<b>1.7 - shfreetds</b>
</p><p>

This initiates a FreeTDS connection, which can be used to connect to MS-SQL
and SyBase (amongst others).  The syntax is....

</p><p>
</p><pre>        shfreetds connectarg [connectarg] ...
</pre>
<p>

The connectarg(s) are concatonated together separated by spaces.  So for
example, the following is perfectlly legal....
</p><p>

</p><pre>        shfreetds server=test dbname=test user=myuser
</pre>
<p>

which does the same thing as
</p><p>

</p><pre>        shfreetds "server=test dbname=test user=myuser"
</pre>
<p>

Either way, the arguments of the engne take the form of name=value where name
is one of the following.  Most have sensible defaults.
</p><p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="5">
<tbody><tr>
<tr><td align=left><code>server</code></td>
<td align=left>The server name (as in the freetds.conf file) - required.

<tr><td align=left><code>port</code></td>
<td align=left>The TCP port number to connect to on the server</td></tr>

<tr><td align=left><code>dbname</code></td>
<td align=left>The database name</td></tr>

<tr><td align=left><code>user</code></td>
<td align=left>The user name for the connection</td></tr>

<tr><td align=left><code>password</code></td>
<td align=left>The password for the user</td></tr>

<tr><td align=left><code>appname</code></td>
<td align=left>The application name used for the connection</td></tr>

<tr><td align=left><code>host</code></td>
<td align=left>The host name or IP address of the server</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><p>

If you are using the password assignment in the connection then you should
use the "password=mysecret" string as a separate parameter.  The reason for
this is that "shfreetds" will detect it and blank it out in the process
table so someone else doing a "ps" cannot see it.

</p><p>
To use this it is important that you have read the FreeTDS implementation
documentation, especially in creating the "freetds.conf" file correctly.
Also, at time of writing, freetds's "ct" library interface has a bug in it and
should be corrected and recompiled.  This is documented in the "README.freetds"
file.

</p><p>

<b>1.8 - shsqlstart</b>

</p><p>
This is a generic connection routine.  This looks at the environment
variable "SHSQL", and expects it to be "postgres", "sqlite3" or any of
the other engines  then
starts the respective program with the appropriate
parameters.  If it is not recognizeable it starts using "shpostgres".

</p><p>
An example of this working.....

</p><p>
</p><pre>        SHPROG=postgres
        export SHPROG

        HANDLE=`shsqlstart dbname=test`
</pre>
<p>

and so on.

</p><p>
shsqlstart is a small wrapper program.  It expects the appropriate connection
program to be in the same directory as it ("shsqlstart").  This is the
reccomended way of starting "shsql" connection as the "SHSQL" environment
variables can be used in other utilities.
</p><p>

<b>2 - Execution command</b>

</p><p>
<b>2.1 - shsql</b>
</p><p>

The command shsql performs the actual SQL queries.  As it's first
parameter it takes the handle obtained from the connection routine
above.  Subsequent parameters represent the query itself.  So an
example here is....

</p><p>
</p><pre>        shsql $HANDLE "insert into a (b, c) values ('x', 'y')"
</pre>
<p>

Alternatively the SQL parameter can be split.  shsql concatonates
them together separating them with a space....

</p><p>
</p><pre>        shsql $HANDLE "insert into a (b, c)" \
                      "values ('x', 'y')"
</pre>
<p>

Should the query generate rows, then each row is represented by
a value inclosed by double quotes, each field on the row being 
separated with a space, and each row separated by a new line character.
</p><p>

Therefore, the following query....

</p><p>
</p><pre>        shsql $HANDLE "select keyfield, datafield from mydata"
</pre>
<p>

could print on the standard output something like

</p><p>
</p><pre>        "FRED" "FRED BLOGS"
        "DAVID" "DAVID COPERFIELD"
        "JOAN" "JOAN BLOGS"
</pre>
<p>

Should one of the fields contain a double quote character then that
is replaced by 2 double quote characters together.
</p><p>



However - a means to alter the output is to place an optional format parameter
after the handle, this is one of the following:
</p>
<pre>        --csv     = Comma Separated Variable output
        --colon   = Colon(: character) delimeted output - not quoted
        --pipe    = Pipe (| character)  delimited output - not quoted
        --tab     = Tab delimited output - not quoted
        --shell   = Shell (the default, desribed above) output
</pre>
<p>

For example...
</p><p>
</p>
<pre>        shsql $HANDLE --csv "select keyfield, datafield from mydata"
</pre>
<p>

would produce..
</p><p>
</p>
<pre>        "FRED","FRED BLOGS"
        "DAVID","DAVID COPERFIELD"
        "JOAN","JOAN BLOGS"
</pre>
<p>

or
</p><p>
</p>
<pre>        shsql $HANDLE --pipe "select keyfield, datafield from mydata"
</pre>
</p>

would produce
</p><p>
</p>
<pre>        FRED|FRED BLOGS
        DAVID|DAVID COPERFIELD
        JOAN|JOAN BLOGS
</pre>
<p>
If no parameters (apart from the HANDLE) are provided then <code>shsql</code>
takes the standar input as the SQL command:

</p><p>
</p><pre>        echo "insert into a (b, c) values('x', 'y')" | shsql $HANDLE
</pre>
<p>

<b>2.2 - Caveats</b>
</p><p>

At time of writing no more than one "shsql" command can be actime on
the same handle (or connection) at any one time.  Should transaction
processing be required you should save the output of the query to a file...

</p><p>
</p><pre>
        shsql $HANDLE "select keyfield, datafield from mydata" &gt; tempfile

        # Now for the transaction processing....

        cat tempfile (
                while ROW=`shsqlline`
                do
                        eval set $ROW

                        shsql $HANDLE "update stats" \
                                      "set totallen = totallen + length('$2')"\
                                      "where initialkey = substr('$1', 1, 1)"
                done
        )
</pre>
<p>

or something like that.
</p><p>


Another caveat is that shsql does not really handle binary fields.  Should
this be required then you should escape them in the SQL itself.
</p><p>

<b>2.3 - The shsqlinp command</b>
</p><p>

This command would primarily be used to import data into a table, though it
can be used for other updates as well.  Primarily what it does is execute
(the same) SQL statement for every line of standard input it receives 
performing a rudimentary parameter substitution.  An example of thos could
be....
</p><p>
</p>

<pre>        shsqlinp $HANDLE "insert into mydata (keyfield, datafield)" \
                         "values (?, ?)" \
        &lt;&lt; _EOF
        "JAMES" "JAMES BOND 007"
        "MARY" "MARY QUEEN OF SCOTTS"
        _EOF
</pre>
<p>


or even
</p><p>
</p>

<pre>        shsqlinp $HANDLE "insert into xxx (yyy, zzz) values(?, ?)" < file.txt
</pre>
<p>

Also, perhaps an output from a shsql from another database....
</p><p>
</p>

<pre>        shsql $HANDLE_A "select a, b from cc" | \
        shsqlinp  $HANDLE_B "insert into cc(a, b) values(?, ?)"
</pre>
<p>

However - please note that you cannot use this method to copy data from one
table to another, or to perform other updates,  in the same database connection.
The "client back end" can only execute one statement at a time, so in order to
use ShellSQL to update a table based on another you need to go through
a temporary file...
</p><p>
</p>

<pre>        shsql $HANDLE "select a, b from cc"  &gt; temp.txt
        shsqlinp  $HANDLE "insert into cc(a, b) values(?, ?)" &lt; temp.txt
</pre>
<p>

The above will work for string, or varchar, type datatypes.  If a number is to
be included then either casting needs to be done in the SQL command itself, or
you can append a "#" to the "?"parameter.  To specify a string you can apend a
"@" character, however, this is not neccessary as this is the default.
</p><p>
</p>

<pre>        shsqlinp $HANDLE "insert into aa (numf, charf) values (?#, ?@)" &lt;&lt; _EOF
        "123" "ORDER ONE-TWO-THREE"
        "-2" "MINUS TWO"
        _EOF
</pre>
<p>

This need not be just used for importing, but can be used for updating, deleting
or other DML type operations..
</p><p>
</p>

<pre>        shsqlinp $HANDLE "update atable set bfield = ? where ckey = ?" &lt;&lt; _EOF
        "NEW DATA FOR A" "KEYA"
        "NEW DATA FOR B" "KEYB"
        _EOF
</pre>
<p>

The format of the input file can be controlled by an optional parameter after the
HANDLE.  These are the same for those in shsql....
</p>
<pre>        --csv     = Comma Separated Variable output
        --colon   = Colon(: character) delimeted output - not quoted
        --pipe    = Pipe (| character)  delimited output - not quoted
        --tab     = Tab delimited output - not quoted
        --shell   = Shell (the default, desribed above) output
</pre>
<p>


<b>3 - shsqlend</b>
</p><p>

This simply terminates the connection and background process...

</p><p>
</p><pre>        shsqlend $HANDLE
</pre>
<p>

It is important that the handle/connection is not accessed after this
is called.
</p><p>
It is important to call this however, should you do not then processes
and message queues will remain running in the background.  Should this
happen then these processes can be killed using the LINUX/UNIX <code>kill</code>, 
or the LINUX <code>killall</code> command.  Though if this <i>is</i> done then
the <code>-9</code> option should <b>not</b> be used.
</p><p>


<b>4 - Sundry Utilities</b>
</p><p>

<b>4.1 - Introduction</b>
</p><p>

Some utilities accompany the suite to assist with the shell scripts, these
do not connect to the SQL client background process in the same way as the
above but they are designed to work with the suite.
</p><p>

<b>4.2 - shsqlline</b>
</p><p>

First the technological description - this is complicated so please feel free
to ignore it and go straight to the example below...
</p><p>

This takes a rowset as produced by a select query using "shsql" as a 
standard input, and prints out the first row of this returning 0.  If
the end of file is reached then it fails by returning 1.  
</p><p>

Example:

</p><p>
</p><pre>        shsql $HANDLE "select * from mytable" &gt; tempfile
        cat tempfile | (
                while ROW=`shsqlline`
                do
                        eval set $ROW
                        ....

                done
        )
        rm tempfile
</pre>
<p>

This can be shoertened to...

</p><p>
</p><pre>                                      
        shsql $HANDLE "select * from mytable"  | (
                while ROW=`shsqlline`
                do
                        eval set $ROW
                        ....

                done
        )
</pre>
<p>

To go through it line by line.....

</p><p>
</p><pre>        shsql $HANDLE "select * from mytable"  | (
</pre>
<p>

This runs sgsql then pipes the rowset (standartd output) to a
sub-shell which...

</p><p>
</p><pre>                while ROW=`shsqlline`
                do
</pre>
<p>

goes into a loop that reads the first then next line of the rowset
and placing it into a variable called ROW, the loop then...

</p><p>
</p><pre>                eval set $ROW
</pre>
<p>

places the first field in $1, second in $2 and so on.  The "eval" 
appears to be needed to properly evaluate the double quotes and
spaces in variables.
</p><p>


If you have not fully uderstood this it is unimportant as long as you
know how to enumerate the row set.
</p><p>

Please not too, that if you wish to perform other transactions on the same
$HANDLE in the loop you need to use the "tempfile" method.
</p><p>


<b>4.3 - shsqlesc</b>
</p><p>

This takes as it's parameter(s) and prints on the standard output a string
that has the quotes etc escaped suitable for string parameters in SQL queries.
Please note it places the preceding and postceding 's on the string too.
Bear in mind that different SQL engines use different escape routines
so this uses the SHSQL parameter to control precisely how it
behaves (defaulting to postgres).

Example:

</p><p>
</p><pre>        SQLPAR=`shsqlesc "Bobby's Girl"`
</pre>
<p>

would place the value

</p><p>
</p><pre>        'Bobb''s Girl'
</pre>
<p>

including all the quotes into SQLPAR.
</p><p>

The behaviour of this command is effected by the <code>SHSQL</code>
environment variable.  Different engines have slightly different 
escape rules, and <code>shsqlesc</code> will alter the way
it behaves accordingly, so <code>SHSQL</code> should be set 
accordingly (as in the <code>shsqlstart</code> program).  If
it is not it defaults to <code>postgres</code>.
</p></body></html>
